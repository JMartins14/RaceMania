# RaceMania

A car browser game was developed in two modes: SinglePlayer where the player could win medals depending on the time it took to finish the track and Multiplayer mode where the player could play against another player on the same computer. In addition, players could consult a table of HighScores.


<b>This project was developed under a chair of the 2nd year of the University of Coimbra by a group of 3 students </b>
